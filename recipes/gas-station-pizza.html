    <h1>Gas Station Pizza</h1>
<img src="../img/gas-station-pizza.jpg" alt="Gas station pizza picture :)">

<p>
    This is a pizza my friends and I made at the end of one of our annual trips with some leftover food. <strong>It should not be made by anyone.</strong> If you want
    to try it and see how it goes I guess you could do that.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Stale tortillas</li>
    <li>Leftover Cheeze</li>
    <li>Salsa</li>
    <li>Some gas station weiners</li>
    <li>Anything else left in your fridge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Spread your salsa generously over 1 side of the tortillas</li>
    <li>Apply cheese unevenly across each of them</li>
    <li>Cut weiners into pieces and just sort of throw them on there</li>
    <li>Put into oven and contemplate your life choices</li>
    <li>cook until slightly burned</li>
    <li>after cooling, attempt to eat</li>
</ol>
